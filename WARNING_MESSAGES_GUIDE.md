## üéØ How to Tell if Script is Working Correctly

### ‚úÖ **Signs of Healthy Execution:**

1. **Loading Phase:**
   ```
   Loading modules...
     ‚úì Loaded: CoreInfrastructure
     ‚úì Loaded: UserInterface
     ‚úì Loaded: LogProcessor
     ‚úì Loaded: ReportGenerator
   ```

2. **Execution Phase:**
   ```
   ‚úì BloatwareRemoval completed (X detected, Y processed)
   ‚úì EssentialApps completed (X detected, Y processed)
   ‚úì SystemOptimization completed (X detected, Y processed)
   ‚úì TelemetryDisable completed (X detected, Y processed)
   ‚úì WindowsUpdates completed (X detected, Y processed)
   ```

3. **Report Generation:**
   ```
   üìã Generating maintenance reports...
     ‚úì Reports generated successfully
     üìÑ HTML: C:\Users\...\MaintenanceReport_2025-10-19_14-30-25.html
   ```

### üö® **Signs of Problems:**

1. **Script exits immediately** - Module loading failed
2. **No reports generated** - Report generation crashed
3. **Multiple ERROR messages** - Configuration or permission issues
4. **"Access denied" repeatedly** - Not running as Administrator

## üîß Troubleshooting Quick Steps

**If you see warnings:**
1. Check if they're in the "Expected" category above ‚Üí Ignore them
2. If in "Informational" category ‚Üí Note for later, script continues
3. If in "Actual Problems" category ‚Üí Follow fix instructions

**If script fails:**
1. ‚úÖ Run PowerShell as Administrator
2. ‚úÖ Unblock all files: `Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Unblock-File`
3. ‚úÖ Check execution policy: `Get-ExecutionPolicy` (should be RemoteSigned or Unrestricted)
4. ‚úÖ Verify all files extracted properly
5. ‚úÖ Check antivirus hasn't quarantined files

---

**Summary:** Most warnings you see are **expected behavior** - the script is designed to gracefully handle missing features and continue successfully. Only ERROR messages require immediate attention.
