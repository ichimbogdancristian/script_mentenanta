i am thinking of a refactoring of the entire project,
i want you to do a comprehensive scan off all the modules in this project, 
do a comprehensive analysis of how preexisting lists and diff lists work ,
why there is a SystemInventory module in the type2 folder this is a type1 module clearly .. propose a solution for that 
in the next version of my project i want type1 modules to be run first and determine witch type2 modules need to be run
i want to refactor all type 1 inventory modules to corespond every type 2 that will have os dependent functions so if earlyer windows 10 is detected it should run a specific part of the module (function) and so on for windows 11
i want you to consolidate SecurityEnhancement.psm1 and SecurityEnhancementCIS.psm1 into a single module SecurityEnhancement and remove the other
I want you to consolidate SystemOptimization.psm1 and TelemetryDisable.psm1 into a single module SystemOptimization and remove the other
i think all modules in /modules should have structured functions inside them for windows 10 and for windows 11
i think based on the findings that the new system inventory the orchstrator should decide if for example EssentiakApps module should run
I want you to give me an onest opinion about my refactoring plan pluses and minuses
i want suggestions about my plan
create extensive and detailed documentation 
this is a complex task split it in to multiple tasks 
analyse carrefouly dont rush things do it right


i want you to do a individual comprehensive scan off all the modules in this project analyze how logs are produced stored interpreted processed , analyze data format field types paths everything, find out what is brocken or out of place
