# Project Refactoring & Infrastructure Analysis Prompt

## 🎯 Objective
Perform a comprehensive audit and refactoring plan for the Windows Maintenance Automation System (v3.1.0). Analyze current architecture, identify issues, propose consolidations, and create a detailed roadmap for next-generation improvements.

## 🔑 Key Questions to Address
1. **OS-Specific Architecture**: Should the project have different execution types based on Windows 10 or 11?
   - Option A: Different functions inside each module depending on OS type?
   - Option B: Entirely different modules for each OS version?
   - **Critical**: At what point in the execution flow should this OS split occur?

2. **Module Consolidation**: Which modules have similar goals and can be consolidated to reduce duplication and improve maintainability?

## 📊 Phase 1: Comprehensive Module Analysis

### Module Classification & Organization
- **Audit all modules** in /modules/type1/ and /modules/type2/
- **Identify misplaced modules**: Why is SystemInventory in type2 when it's clearly Type1?
- **Analyze Type1 modules** as a cohesive entity - look for:
  - Overlapping functionality
  - Inconsistent data structures
  - Missing audit capabilities
  - Consolidation opportunities

- **Analyze Type2 modules** as a cohesive entity - look for:
  - Duplicate code patterns
  - Inconsistent execution flows
  - Missing DryRun implementations
  - Consolidation opportunities

### Data Structure Analysis
- **Preexisting lists vs diff lists**: How do they work? Why both systems?
- **Logging mechanisms**: 
  - How are logs produced, stored, interpreted, and processed?
  - What formats are used? (JSON, text, structured objects)
  - What field types and paths are used?
  - Are there broken paths or inconsistent formats?

- **Inventory system**:
  - How is inventory created?
  - How is it processed?
  - What data structures are used?
  - Is the flow efficient?

## 🏗️ Phase 2: Core Infrastructure Deep Dive

### Investigate Every Core Module (100% Coverage)
Analyze the following without using shortcuts or automation:

1. **CoreInfrastructure.psm1**
   - Path discovery mechanisms
   - Configuration loading
   - Global state management
   - Identify unused code blocks

2. **LogAggregator.psm1**
   - Result collection patterns
   - Data correlation logic
   - Session management

3. **LogProcessor.psm1**
   - Data processing pipeline
   - Parsing logic
   - Analytics generation

4. **ReportGenerator.psm1**
   - Template system
   - Report rendering
   - Output formats

5. **TemplateEngine.psm1**
   - Template loading & caching
   - Placeholder replacement
   - Path resolution

6. **ModuleRegistry.psm1**
   - Module discovery
   - Dependency validation

7. **CommonUtilities.psm1**
   - Shared helpers
   - Reusability analysis

8. **UserInterface.psm1**
   - Menu systems
   - Progress tracking

### Look For
- ❌ **Unused code blocks**
- ❌ **Faulty logic**
- ❌ **Broken paths**
- ❌ **Inconsistent naming conventions**
- ❌ **Inconsistent data types and formats**
- ❌ **Overlapping functionality**
- ❌ **Performance bottlenecks**

## 🔄 Phase 3: Proposed Refactoring Goals

### 1. Intelligent Orchestration
**Goal**: Type1 modules run first and determine which Type2 modules need execution

**Requirements**:
- System inventory runs before all operations
- Type1 audit results drive Type2 execution decisions
- Orchestrator uses findings to skip unnecessary Type2 modules
- Example: If EssentialAppsAudit finds all apps installed, skip EssentialApps.psm1

### 2. OS-Specific Function Architecture
**Goal**: All modules support Windows 10 and Windows 11 with dedicated functions

**Structure**:
```powershell
# Example pattern
function Invoke-Module {
    $osVersion = Get-WindowsVersion
    
    if ($osVersion -eq "Windows10") {
        Invoke-Windows10Specific
    }
    elseif ($osVersion -eq "Windows11") {
        Invoke-Windows11Specific
    }
}
```

**Requirements**:
- Every Type1 module has OS-specific functions
- Every Type2 module has OS-specific functions
- Type1 modules correspond to every Type2 module with OS dependencies
- Early detection: If Windows 10 detected, run specific code path

### 3. Module Consolidation

#### Security Module Consolidation
**Action**: Merge `SecurityEnhancement.psm1` + `SecurityEnhancementCIS.psm1`
- **Target**: Single module `SecurityEnhancement.psm1`
- **Remove**: SecurityEnhancementCIS.psm1
- **Rationale**: Avoid duplication, unified security baseline (CIS integrated)

#### System Optimization Consolidation
**Action**: Merge `SystemOptimization.psm1` + `TelemetryDisable.psm1`
- **Target**: Single module `SystemOptimization.psm1`
- **Remove**: TelemetryDisable.psm1
- **Rationale**: Telemetry control is part of system optimization

### 4. Type1/Type2 Correspondence
**Goal**: Perfect 1:1 mapping between audit and action modules

**Required Pairs**:
- BloatwareDetectionAudit ↔ BloatwareRemoval ✓
- EssentialAppsAudit ↔ EssentialApps ✓
- SystemOptimizationAudit ↔ SystemOptimization ✓
- SecurityAudit ↔ SecurityEnhancement ✓
- WindowsUpdatesAudit ↔ WindowsUpdates ✓
- TelemetryAudit ↔ (merge into SystemOptimization) ⚠️
- AppUpgradeAudit ↔ AppUpgrade ✓
- SystemInventory ↔ (move to Type1) ⚠️
